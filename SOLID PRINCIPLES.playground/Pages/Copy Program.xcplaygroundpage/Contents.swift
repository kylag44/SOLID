 ## Agile Design
 
 * With time all complex programs naturally exibit a kind of entropy, which is technically referred to as "rot" ü§ì.
 * Rotting code is hard to maintain & hard to add features to.
 * In non-agile shops design begins to degrade as requirements change.
 * Although initally changes to the code may "work", in time, violations accumulate and rot sets in.
 
 
 ### The Signs of Software Rot (Design Smells)
 
 * _Rigidity_: hard to change; even simple changes can affect other (unrelated) parts of the program (often unanticipated ) & so a change in one place requires  changes elsewhere.
 * _Fragility_: changes cause code to break in unrelated parts of the code.
 * _Immobility_: difficult to disentangle code for reuse (lacks modularity).
 * _Viscosity_: changes that preserve the design are harder to make than hacks, which means that the design begins to deteriorate with time.
 * _Needless Complexity_: includes infrastructure that adds no direct benefit, often added in anticipation of future change (live in the present üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
 * _Needless Repetition_: contains repetition of code, often with slight variations, that could be unified by an abstraction.
 * _Opacity_: intent is not apparent & the program is therefore difficult to understand & reason about.

/*:
 ## The Copy Program: Let's Watch Code Rot!
 * Copy is a simple program.
 * It Takes input from the Keyboard module and outputs it to the Printer module.

/*:
 ## 1st Change
 * The client would like the Copy app to also be able read from a *tape reader* üöë.
 * You'd like to pass a Bool into the copy function. What's the problem with changing the signature of `Copy1's copy()` method by adding a Bool parameter on an in production app?
 * Since you can't add a Bool to the signature of `copy` how can we add logic to handle sometimes using a *tape reader*?

/*:
 * What specific design smells did the old Copy program exhibit?
 */
/*:
 * Copy is a "higher level module" than either the Printer or the Keyboard.
 * By this we mean that `Copy` is less concrete than either Printer or Keyboard.
 * If we think about what `copy()` does generally then we can say that it takes an input (it doesn't really care about the source ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) from an input device and passes it to an output device (it doesn't care about the output device ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
 * The Printer module and the Keyboard module are both more concrete. They output to paper, and input from a keyboard respectively.
 * So, what we have is a dependency from a higher level module Copy (more abstract) and two lower level modules that are tangled up with specific details (more concrete). Copy is dependent on modules that are more concrete than it is.
 * The problem with Copy being dependent on the concrete details of Printer and Keyboard is that when these change then they break Copy. We are forced to update Copy to make a change.
 * What creating an interface does for us is wrap the concrete Printer and Keyboard in an abstract wrapper so that we can refer to them abstractly, and hence we are no longer dependent on any concrete details.
 * This is a good example of what is called _dependency inversion_ üôÉ.
 * We are also utilizing polymorphism. Explain.
 * Another way of describing what we've done to solve this problem is that we have "encapsulated", that is separated into its own structure, those dependencies that are likely to change, namely the concrete input and output entities.
 * The Copy program introduces a lot of powerful ideas that we will explore by considering each of the SOLID principles in turn.
