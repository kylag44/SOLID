/*:
 * Decoy is forced to depend on its super class's abstract fly() method even though it doesn't implement fly() (it's forced to implement it and it does nothing ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¡).
 * The problem with this is that if the interface's signature were to change, then it would break our Decoy Duck even though it doesn't even need this method! This makes our program unnecessarily fragile in the face of change.
 * The solution to this is to create a separate interface for Flyable and only have Mallard conform and not Decoy.
 * This is "composition over inheritance". We create objects by composing them of select behaviors rather than inherit these.
