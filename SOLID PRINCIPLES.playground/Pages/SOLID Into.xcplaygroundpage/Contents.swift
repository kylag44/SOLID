 ## SOLID PRINCIPLES
 
 * If you hope to make a career out of programming you must move beyond just making code "work"
 * That's not good enough
 * Code needs to be well designed, easy to understand, easy to add features to and easy to maintain
 * One way to start this journey is to learn the fundamentals of OOD (Object Oriented Design)
 * OOD involves learning Design Patterns, and the principles underlying them
 * Everyone here has already been exposed to at least some design patterns, like the Delegate Pattern, Observer (NSNoticationCenter), Singleton (UIApplication), MVC, etc.
 * Rather than looking at concrete patterns today, I'm going to discuss some of the some important rules of thumb that guide OOD.
 * I'm going to discuss the SOLID principles, as found in Uncle Bob's (Robert Martin) _Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices_.
 * SOLID is an acronym that summarizes 5 basic principles of OOP and OOD
 * Applying these principles improves the chances that your program will be easy to maintain and extend over time
